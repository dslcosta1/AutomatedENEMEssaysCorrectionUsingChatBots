      "\n",
      "Eis os seis níveis de desempenho: \n",
      "200 pontos - Desenvolve o tema por meio de argumentação consistente, a partir de um repertório sociocultural produtivo e apresenta excelente domínio do texto dissertativo-argumentativo.\n",
      "160 pontos - Desenvolve o tema por meio de argumentação consistente e apresenta bom domínio do texto argumentativo-dissertativo, com proposição, argumentação e conclusão\n",

      "\n",
      "----\n",
      "3. Selecionar, relacionar, organizar e interpretar informações, fatos, opiniões e argumentos em defesa de um ponto de vista\n",
      "\n",
      "O candidato precisa elaborar um texto que apresente, claramente, uma ideia a ser defendida e os argumentos que justifiquem a posição assumida em relação à temática da proposta da redação. Trata da coerência e da plausibilidade entre as ideias apresentadas no texto, o que é garantido pelo planejamento prévio à escrita, ou seja, pela elaboração de um projeto de texto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eis os seis níveis de desempenho: \n",
      "\n",
      "200 pontos - Apresenta informações, fatos e opiniões relacionados ao tema proposto, de forma consistente e organizada, configurando autoria, em defesa de um ponto de vista.\n",

      "4. Conhecimento dos mecanismos linguísticos necessários para a construção da argumentação\n",
      "\n",
      "São avaliados itens relacionados à estruturação lógica e formal entre as partes da redação. A organização textual exige que as frases e os parágrafos estabeleçam entre si uma relação que garanta uma sequência coerente do texto e a interdependência entre as ideias.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preposições, conjunções, advérbios e locuções adverbiais são responsáveis pela coesão do texto porque estabelecem uma inter-relação entre orações, frases e parágrafos. Cada parágrafo será composto por um ou mais períodos também articulados. Cada ideia nova precisa estabelecer relação com as anteriores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abaixo, seguem os seis níveis de desempenho:\n",
      "200 pontos - Articula bem as partes do texto e apresenta repertório diversificado de recursos coesivos.\n",

Para a proposta de intervenção ser considerada completa, é preciso ter cinco elementos, sendo eles: agente, ação, meio, finalidade e detalhamento, além de estar de acordo com os direitos humanos.\n",
